This directory will contain example code of how to parse the file format
with


https://github.com/dcodeIO/ProtoBuf.js/


For a HTML file you could first install ProtoBuf.js and then
refer to it

<script src="file:///home/user/protobuf.js/dist/protobuf.min.js"></script>


Open question, is the protobuf.min.js available in any CDN?
